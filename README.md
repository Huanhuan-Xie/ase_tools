Tools dependent of the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE). 

The tools have been developed for VASP calculations. Some tools depend on Matplotlib. 

``ASE tools'' include functions such as 

(i) plotting a slice of a CHGCAR or LOCPOT file. This can be done in any directions thanks to interpolation using fourier transformations,
(ii) averaging a CHGCAR or LOCPOT file in one direction to make a 1D curve,
(iii) adding electron densities from CHGCAR files,
(iv) calculating electron density differences between different CHGCAR files.
